## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities or concerns in our repository, please report them to our security team via email at [vipul.k@enkel.ca](mailto:vipul.k@enkel.ca) and [kiran.dash@enkel.ca](mailto:kiran.dash@enkel.ca). We appreciate responsible disclosure and will address issues promptly.

## Secure Development Practices

We adhere to secure coding practices to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in our codebase. Our developers are trained in secure coding techniques and follow industry best practices to ensure our code remains secure.

## Code Review

All code changes undergo a thorough review process to identify and address potential security issues. Our team of experienced developers performs detailed code reviews to maintain the integrity and security of our repository.

## Authentication and Authorization

We implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure user access to our systems. Authentication is performed securely, and access controls are enforced to ensure that only authorized individuals can access or modify resources.

## Data Encryption

We use industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. Our encryption practices are designed to safeguard user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Third-Party Dependencies

We carefully evaluate and monitor third-party dependencies used in our repository. Dependencies are regularly updated to address known security vulnerabilities, and we perform security assessments to minimize potential risks.

## Security Testing

Regular security testing is conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This includes automated vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and comprehensive security assessments to ensure the robustness of our systems.

## Security Incident Response

We have a defined incident response plan to address security incidents. Our team investigates and responds to breaches promptly, taking necessary actions to mitigate impact and prevent recurrence.

## Continuous Security Improvement

Security is an ongoing process. We continuously review and enhance our security practices, stay updated on emerging threats, and adapt our security measures to address evolving risks.

For additional questions or concerns about the security of our repository, please contact our security team at [vipul.k@enkel.ca](mailto:vipul.k@enkel.ca) and [kiran.dash@enkel.ca](mailto:kiran.dash@enkel.ca).
